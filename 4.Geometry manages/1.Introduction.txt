As we’ve seen, creating a new widget doesn’t mean that it appears on the screen. we should call one of the geometry manager, to appear our widget on screen.

They are three types of Geometry managers/Layout managers in Python Tkinter package.
They are:
    pack
    grid
    place.
    
Note: The three layout managers pack, grid, and place should never be mixed in the same master window


Pack: To arrange widgets horizantally or vertically

grid: To arrange widgets based on rows and columns.
      which will give you more flexibility to your widgets.

place: To arrange widgets in absolute position.
