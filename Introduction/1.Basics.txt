Tk is a free and open-source, cross-platform widget toolkit that provides a library of basic elements of GUI widgets for building a 
graphical user interface (GUI) in many programming languages.

Tk is the Library/package/module like python Library/package/module writtent in tcl language.

Tk provides a number of widgets commonly needed to develop desktop applications, such as button, menu, canvas, text, frame, label, etc. 
Tk has been ported to run on most flavors of Linux, Mac OS, Unix, and Microsoft Windows. Like Tcl, Tk supports Unicode within the Basic 
Multilingual Plane but it has not yet been extended to handle 32-bit Unicode.

Note: Bydeafult Tk-tookkit for GUI, will support for tcl language.

Architecture:
=============
Tk is a platform-independent GUI framework developed for Tcl.

Tk has the following characteristics:

Platform-independent: Like Tcl, Tk is interpreted. It has been ported to multiple platforms and can easily run on all of them without 
                      modification.
Customizable:         Almost all the features of a widget in Tk are customizable through options during the creation of the widget or 
                      later on through the configure command.
Configurable:         Many of the options can be stored in an option database, making it very easy to parameterize the look of an 
                      application (such as the color scheme). This also means that storing the application-specific options is only a 
                      matter of saving the option add commands and executing them on loading the application.
                      
Language bindings:
=================
    A library written in one programming language may be used in another language if bindings are written; 
    Tk is integrated with the Tcl language.
    
    Various other languages have bindings for Tk.
    Like: 
        Python (Tkinter is the binding for Tk using python)
        Perl
        Ruby etc...
        
Tk provides various widgets.(widget:something which is usefult to create something)

Basic widgets:
=============
button
canvas
checkbutton
combobox
entry
frame
label
labelframe
listbox
menu
menubutton
message
notebook
panedwindow
progressbar
radiobutton
scale
scrollbar
separator
sizegrip
spinbox
text
tk_optionMenu
treeview

Top-level widgets:
=================
tk_chooseColor – pops up a dialog box for the user to select a color.
tk_chooseDirectory – pops up a dialog box for the user to select a directory.
tk_dialog – creates a modal dialog and waits for a response.
tk_getOpenFile – pops up a dialog box for the user to select a file to open.
tk_getSaveFile – pops up a dialog box for the user to select a file to save.
tk_messageBox – pops up a message window and waits for a user response.
tk_popup – posts a popup menu.
toplevel – creates and manipulates toplevel widgets.

Geometry managers:
==================
Basic widgets are arranged in toplevel windows using geometry managers.

place – positions widgets at absolute locations
grid – arranges widgets in a grid
pack – packs widgets into a cavity
